# Choose programming language

* Status: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

In what programming language it'll be easy to practice DDD?

## Decision Drivers

* Object oriented 
* Supports modules and package
* Easy to use tooling

## Considered Options

* java
* python
* javascript/typescript
* go/rust

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: java, because
* Meets all criteria
* Well adopted and stable
* Statically typed - easier to refactor 

### Positive Consequences

* fast start without learning curve of new language
* learning one thing at a time
* already know how to solve problems with it

### Negative Consequences

* will not learn any new language along the way
* will not practice doing DDD in different languages where things might be easier/harder to achieve

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### java

* Good, because it's statically typed so there is a lot of help from IDE and compiler 
* Good, because I'll be able to peek into newest version and see what's been added
* Good, because I know everything I need to know to effectively work with it
* Good, because I'll be practicing one thing at a time
* Bad, because I'll not learn any new language along the way

### python

* Good, because I like duck typing which speeds up a lot of things
* Good, because it has compact syntax
* Good, because it's easy to test and run
* Good, because it doesn't require ton of additional tools to get started
* Bad, because I'm expecting a lot of refactoring and changing things in time and IDE might not be able to help me with it
* Bad, because it offers visibility only by convention
* Bad, because I might not be able to tell if the problems I'm facing are because of shitty architecture or my lack of knowledge

### javascript

* Good, because I like duck typing which speeds up a lot of things
* Good, because it has compact syntax
* Good, because it's easy to test and run
* Good, because it doesn't require ton of additional tools to get started
* Bad, because I'm expecting a lot of refactoring and changing things in time and IDE might not be able to help me with it
* Bad, because I'll have to spend time to figure out if pure JS is enough or if typescript will be better
* Bad, because I don't know typescript

### go/rust

* Bad, because I don't know these
* Bad, because I'll spend time learning language instead of practicing DDD
