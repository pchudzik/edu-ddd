# how to avoid java verbosity

* Status: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

How to avoid generating tons of getters and setters for simple transfer objects.

## Considered Options

* generate them in intelij
* lombok
* make DTO fields public and final

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: lombok, because it allows to:
* generate builders which provide nice way of creating objects
* generate equals and hashcode which will be useful in testing
* allow to generate constructor to easily create object based on it's dependencies

Avoid using anything but:
* @*Constructor
* @Getter/@Setter on anything but DTO and only when it's necessary
* @EqualsAndHashCode only when necessary

### Positive Consequences

* less code to write/generate

### Negative Consequences

* not vanilla java
* might be tempted to overexpose things
